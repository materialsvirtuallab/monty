# Monty: Python Made Even Easier

Monty is the missing complement to Python. Monty implements supplementary
useful functions for Python that are not part of the standard library.
Examples include useful utilities like transparent support for zipped files,
useful design patterns such as singleton and cached_class, and many more.

Python is a great programming language and comes with "batteries
included". However, even Python has missing functionality and/or quirks that
make it more difficult to do many simple tasks. In the process of
creating several large scientific frameworks based on Python,
my co-developers and I have found that it is often useful to create
reusable utility  functions to supplement the Python standard library. Our
forays in various developer sites and forums also found that many developers
are looking for solutions to the same problems.

Monty is created to serve as a complement to the Python standard library. It
provides suite of tools to solve many common problems, and hopefully,
be a resource to collect the best solutions.

Monty supports Python 3.x.
